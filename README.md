8. **Create Dashboards and Alerts**:
   - Create dashboards in Grafana to visualize the metrics collected by Prometheus.
   - Set up alerts for key metrics to monitor application performance and health.

## ðŸ§ª Testing

To run the unit and integration tests:
```bash
php artisan test
```

## ðŸš€ Deployment

The application is configured for **CI/CD** using **GitHub Actions**, deploying automatically to staging and production environments upon merging changes to the `main` branch.

## ðŸ“„ Logging Setup and Usage Guidelines

### Logging Framework

The application uses the built-in Laravel logging system, which is based on the Monolog library. The logging configuration is located in the `config/logging.php` file.

### Logging Channels

Two new logging channels have been added:

1. **Deployments Channel**: Logs deployment events.
2. **Application Channel**: Logs application errors, warnings, and information events.

### Configuration

The logging channels are configured in the `config/logging.php` file:

```php
'channels' => [
    // Other channels...

    'deployments' => [
        'driver' => 'single',
        'path' => storage_path('logs/deployments.log'),
        'level' => env('LOG_LEVEL', 'info'),
    ],

    'application' => [
        'driver' => 'daily',
        'path' => storage_path('logs/application.log'),
        'level' => env('LOG_LEVEL', 'debug'),
        'days' => 14,
    ],
],
```

### Usage

#### Logging Application Events

To log application events, use the `Log` facade in your code:

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Log;

// Log an info message
Log::channel('application')->info('This is an informational message.');

// Log a warning message
Log::channel('application')->warning('This is a warning message.');

// Log an error message
Log::channel('application')->error('This is an error message.');
```

#### Logging Deployment Events

Deployment events are logged automatically in the GitHub Actions workflows. The following steps have been added to the `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and `.github/workflows/main_capstoneproject.yml` files:

```yaml
# Log successful deployment
- name: Log successful deployment
  if: success()
  run: echo "Deployment successful" >> deployment.log

# Log failed deployment
- name: Log failed deployment
  if: failure()
  run: echo "Deployment failed" >> deployment.log
```
